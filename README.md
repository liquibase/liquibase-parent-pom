# :star: Liquibase Parent POM

Simplifying Extension Dependency Management with Parent POM

This repository helps craft a parent POM file that becomes the central parent for all extension repositories.

## :pushpin: Features

- Centralized configuration for Liquibase extension projects.
- Easy inheritance for common settings and plugins.
- Simplifies project management and distribution.

## :wrench: Usage

1. Add the following to your Liquibase extension project's `pom.xml` to inherit from this parent POM:

    ```xml
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.liquibase</groupId>
        <artifactId>liquibase-parent-pom</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.0</version> <!-- Replace with the desired version -->
    </parent>
    ```

2. Customize your extension project as needed. Your project inherits common properties, plugins, and distribution management settings from this parent POM.
